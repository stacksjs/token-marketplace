## Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling: handle errors and edge cases early
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors
- Use `@stacksjs/error-handling`, which is similar to neverthrow, to handle errors and responses
