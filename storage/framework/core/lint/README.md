Easily get your project linted. It "just works."

- Auto fix for formatting (aimed to be used as standalone without Prettier)

- Lint also for json, yaml, markdown
- Sorted imports, dangling commas for cleaner commit diff
- Improved component library linting & formatting
- Stacks support
- Laravel support
- ESLint wrapper
- And various other minor additions, i.e. `no-constant-binary-expression` usage

> "Reasonable defaults, best practices, only one-line of config."
