# The Config Folder

This `config` folder contains your Stacks configuration files. Each file comes with its descriptions, allowing you to easily and progressively learn at your own pace.

_No worries, it may look intimidating, but configuring is easy due to its fully-typed nature._

> [!NOTE]
> You may not need all these config files. For example, if you are not interacting with any database, you can safely delete the `database.ts` config file.
