# Get Started

A core Stacks principle is to utilize sensible defaults. This means that itâ€™s incredibly easy to get started with this framework. However, Stacks is also very flexible and allows you to customize every aspect of it.

This guide will help you get started with your first Stacks project. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# not working atm
curl -Ssf stacksjs.org | sh # wip

# alternatively, if Bun >= v1.1.29 is installed already,
# you may also get started via:
bunx stacks new my-project
```
