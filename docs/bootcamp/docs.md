# How to build a documentation?

Building a documentation is simple, and Stacks helps you every step of the way.

The source of the documentation frontend lives in `./docs`. Under the hood, Stacks is powered by [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/), and, in short, the markdown files in `./docs` are compiled into a static website that is automatically served by the Stacks server.

Check out ./config/docs.ts for all the configuration options.
